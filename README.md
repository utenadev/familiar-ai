familiar-ai is an AI companion that lives in your home.
Set it up in minutes. No coding required.

It perceives the real world through cameras, moves around on a robot body, speaks aloud, and remembers what it sees. Give it a name, write its personality, and let it live with you.

## What it can do

- 👁 **See** — captures images from a Wi-Fi PTZ camera or USB webcam
- 🔄 **Look around** — pans and tilts the camera to explore its surroundings
- 🦿 **Move** — drives a robot vacuum to roam the room
- 🗣 **Speak** — talks via ElevenLabs TTS
- 🎙 **Listen** — hands-free voice input via ElevenLabs Realtime STT (opt-in)
- 🧠 **Remember** — actively stores and recalls memories with semantic search (SQLite + embeddings)
- 🫀 **Theory of Mind** — takes the other person's perspective before responding
- 💭 **Desire** — has its own internal drives that trigger autonomous behavior
- 🌐 **Global Workspace** — perception, memory, desires, and predictions compete for attention; only the most salient wins
- 🔮 **Prediction** — tracks what it expects to see; surprise lowers the attention threshold
- 🔍 **Attention Schema** — maintains a self-model of what it's focused on and why
- 💤 **Default Mode** — mind-wanders when idle, spontaneously surfacing memories and associations
- 🔬 **Meta-cognition** — observes its own reasoning steps each turn

## How it works

familiar-ai runs a [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) loop powered by your choice of LLM. It perceives the world through tools, thinks about what to do next, and acts — just like a person would.

```
user input
  → think → act (camera / move / speak / remember) → observe → think → ...
```

When idle, it acts on its own desires: curiosity, wanting to look outside, missing the person it lives with.

### Global Workspace Architecture

Under the hood, familiar-ai implements a [Global Workspace Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11407)-inspired architecture. Rather than dumping everything into the LLM prompt, specialized processors compete for a central workspace each turn — and only the winner gets full representation:

```
Specialized processors (run in parallel each turn)
  ├─ Desires       — what it wants right now
  ├─ Scene         — what it perceives (prediction error: surprise → heightened awareness)
  ├─ Memory        — what it recalls
  ├─ Theory of Mind — what the other person might be thinking
  ├─ Self-narrative — continuity of identity
  ├─ Exploration   — curiosity about unvisited directions
  ├─ Attention Schema — self-model of its own focus
  ├─ Prediction    — expected vs actual world state
  └─ Default Mode  — mind-wandering when nothing else ignites
          │
          ▼  compete (ignition threshold)
   ┌─────────────┐
   │  Workspace  │  winner → LLM prompt (bottleneck)
   │  broadcast  │  others → peripheral summary (1 line each)
   └─────────────┘
          │
          └──▶ Meta-Monitor records each step ("what was I attending to?")
```

This creates **selective attention** — not everything reaches the LLM on every turn, only what matters most.

## Choosing an LLM

> **Recommended: Kimi K2.5** — best agentic performance tested so far. Notices context, asks follow-up questions, and acts autonomously in ways other models don't. Priced similarly to Claude Haiku.

| Platform | `PLATFORM=` | Default model | Where to get key |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Moonshot Kimi K2.5** | `kimi` | `kimi-k2.5` | [platform.moonshot.ai](https://platform.moonshot.ai) |
| Z.AI GLM | `glm` | `glm-4.6v` | [api.z.ai](https://api.z.ai) |
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| Google Gemini | `gemini` | `gemini-2.5-flash` | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `gpt-4o-mini` | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| OpenAI-compatible (Ollama, vllm…) | `openai` + `BASE_URL=` | — | — |
| OpenRouter.ai (multi-provider) | `openai` + `BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | — | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) |
| **CLI tool** (claude -p, ollama…) | `cli` | (the command) | — |

**Kimi K2.5 `.env` example:**
```env
PLATFORM=kimi
API_KEY=sk-...   # from platform.moonshot.ai
AGENT_NAME=Yukine
```

**Z.AI GLM `.env` example:**
```env
PLATFORM=glm
API_KEY=...   # from api.z.ai
MODEL=glm-4.6v   # vision-enabled; glm-4.7 / glm-5 = text-only
AGENT_NAME=Yukine
```

**Google Gemini `.env` example:**
```env
PLATFORM=gemini
API_KEY=AIza...   # from aistudio.google.com
MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash  # or gemini-2.5-pro for higher capability
AGENT_NAME=Yukine
```

**OpenRouter.ai `.env` example:**
```env
PLATFORM=openai
BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
API_KEY=sk-or-...   # from openrouter.ai
MODEL=mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct  # optional: specify model
AGENT_NAME=Yukine
```

> **Note:** To disable local/NVIDIA models, simply don't set `BASE_URL` to a local endpoint like `http://localhost:11434/v1`. Use cloud providers instead.

**CLI tool `.env` example:**
```env
PLATFORM=cli
MODEL=llm -m gemma3 {}        # llm CLI (https://llm.datasette.io) — {} = prompt arg
# MODEL=ollama run gemma3:27b  # Ollama — no {}, prompt goes via stdin
```

---

## MCP Servers

familiar-ai can connect to any [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server. This lets you plug in external memory, filesystem access, web search, or any other tool.

Configure servers in `~/.familiar-ai.json` (same format as Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user"]
    },
    "memory": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Two transport types are supported:
- **`stdio`**: launch a local subprocess (`command` + `args`)
- **`sse`**: connect to an HTTP+SSE server (`url`)

Override the config file location with `MCP_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json`.

---

## Hardware

familiar-ai works with whatever hardware you have — or none at all.

| Part | What it does | Example | Required? |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Wi-Fi PTZ camera | Eyes + neck | Tapo C220 (~$30) | **Recommended** |
| Wi-Fi camera (fixed) | Eyes only | Eufy C220 (no pan/tilt) | Optional |
| USB webcam | Eyes (fixed) | Any UVC camera | **Recommended** |
| Robot vacuum | Legs | Any Tuya-compatible model | No |
| PC / Raspberry Pi | Brain | Anything that runs Python | **Yes** |

> **A camera is strongly recommended.** Without one, familiar-ai can still talk — but it can't see the world, which is kind of the whole point.

### Minimal setup (no hardware)

Just want to try it? You only need an API key:

```env
PLATFORM=kimi
API_KEY=sk-...
```

Run `./run.sh` (macOS/Linux/WSL2) or `run.bat` (Windows) and start chatting. Add hardware as you go.

### Wi-Fi PTZ camera (Tapo C220)

1. In the Tapo app: **Settings → Advanced → Camera Account** — create a local account (not TP-Link account)
2. Find the camera's IP in your router's device list
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   CAMERA_HOST=192.168.1.xxx
   CAMERA_USERNAME=your-local-user
   CAMERA_PASSWORD=your-local-pass
   ```

### Wi-Fi camera (Eufy C220)

[Eufy C220 on Amazon Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQQQ5NZ1/)

> **Streaming works. Pan/tilt does NOT work.** The Eufy C220 has no ONVIF PTZ service and no HTTP control API. For a camera with working pan/tilt, use the **Tapo C220** instead.

1. In the Eufy Security app: go to the camera → **Settings → NAS(RTSP)** and enable it
2. Set **Authentication** to **Basic** (Digest authentication does NOT work)
3. Set a streaming username and password
4. Note the RTSP URL shown in the app (format: `rtsp://username:password@ip/live0`)
5. Set in `.env` — use the **full RTSP URL** as `CAMERA_HOST`:
   ```env
   CAMERA_HOST=rtsp://your-username:your-password@192.168.1.xxx/live0
   CAMERA_USERNAME=
   CAMERA_PASSWORD=
   ```
   Leave `CAMERA_USERNAME` and `CAMERA_PASSWORD` empty — credentials are already in the URL.

> **Note:** Eufy C220 allows only **one simultaneous RTSP connection**. If another app (e.g. a Wi-Fi cam MCP server) is connected to the same camera, familiar-ai will fail to get frames. Stop other clients before starting familiar-ai.

### Voice (ElevenLabs)

1. Get an API key at [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io/)
2. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_...
   ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...   # optional, uses default voice if omitted
   ```

There are two playback destinations, controlled by `TTS_OUTPUT`:

```env
TTS_OUTPUT=local    # PC speaker (default)
TTS_OUTPUT=remote   # camera speaker only
TTS_OUTPUT=both     # camera speaker + PC speaker simultaneously
```

#### A) Camera speaker (via go2rtc)

Set `TTS_OUTPUT=remote` (or `both`). Requires [go2rtc](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/releases):

1. Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/AlexxIT/go2rtc/releases):
   - Linux/macOS: `go2rtc_linux_amd64` / `go2rtc_darwin_amd64`
   - **Windows: `go2rtc_win64.exe`**

2. Place and rename it:
   ```
   # Linux / macOS
   ~/.cache/embodied-claude/go2rtc/go2rtc          # chmod +x required

   # Windows
   %USERPROFILE%\.cache\embodied-claude\go2rtc\go2rtc.exe
   ```

3. Create `go2rtc.yaml` in the same directory:
   ```yaml
   streams:
     tapo_cam:
       - rtsp://YOUR_CAM_USER:YOUR_CAM_PASS@YOUR_CAM_IP/stream1
   ```
   Use the local camera account credentials (not your TP-Link cloud account).

4. familiar-ai starts go2rtc automatically at launch. If your camera supports two-way audio (backchannel), voice plays from the camera speaker.

#### B) Local PC speaker

The default (`TTS_OUTPUT=local`). Tries players in order: **paplay** → **mpv** → **ffplay**. Also used as a fallback when `TTS_OUTPUT=remote` and go2rtc is unavailable.

| OS | Install |
|----|---------|
| macOS | `brew install mpv` |
| Ubuntu / Debian | `sudo apt install mpv` (or `paplay` via `pulseaudio-utils`) |
| WSL2 / WSLg | `sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils` — set `PULSE_SERVER=unix:/mnt/wslg/PulseServer` in `.env` |
| Windows | [mpv.io/installation](https://mpv.io/installation/) — download and add to PATH, **or** `winget install ffmpeg` |

> If no audio player is available, speech is still generated — it just won't play.

### Voice input (Realtime STT)

Set `REALTIME_STT=true` in `.env` for always-on, hands-free voice input:

```env
REALTIME_STT=true
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_...   # same key as TTS
STT_LANGUAGE=ja            # recommended for Japanese; used by both batch and realtime STT
```

familiar-ai streams microphone audio to ElevenLabs Scribe v2 and auto-commits transcripts when you pause speaking. No button press required. Coexists with the push-to-talk mode (Ctrl+T).

---

## TUI

familiar-ai includes a terminal UI built with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/):

- Scrollable conversation history with live streaming text
- Tab-completion for `/quit`, `/clear`
- Interrupt the agent mid-turn by typing while it's thinking
- **Conversation log** auto-saved to `~/.cache/familiar-ai/chat.log`

To follow the log in another terminal (useful for copy-paste):
```bash
tail -f ~/.cache/familiar-ai/chat.log
```

---

## Persona (ME.md)

Your familiar's personality lives in `ME.md`. This file is gitignored — it's yours alone.

See [`persona-template/en.md`](./persona-template/en.md) for an example, or [`persona-template/ja.md`](./persona-template/ja.md) for a Japanese version.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Does it work without a GPU?**
Yes. The embedding model (multilingual-e5-small) runs fine on CPU. A GPU makes it faster but isn't required.

**Q: Can I use a camera other than Tapo?**
Yes. Any RTSP camera works for `see()`. Tested: **Tapo C220** (ONVIF + RTSP, full pan/tilt) and **Eufy C220** (RTSP only — **pan/tilt not supported**). For pan/tilt, use the Tapo C220.

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**
Images and text are sent to your chosen LLM API for processing. Memories are stored locally in `~/.familiar_ai/`.

**Q: Why does the agent write `（...）` instead of speaking?**
Make sure `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set. Without it, voice is disabled and the agent falls back to text.
